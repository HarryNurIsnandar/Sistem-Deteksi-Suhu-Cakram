# 🚗 Early Warning System for Brake Disc Heat Detection 

## 📌 Overview
This project is an IoT-based early warning system for detecting excessive heat on motor vehicle brake discs. The system uses the ESP8266 microcontroller and MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor to monitor brake disc temperature in real-time. Data is visualized through the Blynk platform and users receive notifications when the temperature exceeds the safety threshold.

## ⚙️ Features
Real-time temperature monitoring of the brake disc.

Early warning notifications via Blynk mobile app.

Data visualization with live charts.

Low-cost, portable, and easy-to-install hardware.

## 🛠 Hardware Requirements
ESP8266 (NodeMCU or Wemos D1 Mini)

MLX90614 Infrared Temperature Sensor

Passive Buzzer

Power Supply (e.g., 18650 battery with power management module)

## 💻 Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (with ESP8266 board support)

Blynk App (iOS/Android)
